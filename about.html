                  and countries followed by the airports and gathers the scores as a "treasure" along the way.
                  First, the program prompts the user to enter his/her name, then the player selects
                  the desired options from all the continents, countries, and one out of three airports
                  of the corresponding country.
                  After each navigation attempt, the player receives information on the number of remaining attempts,
                  the total number of attempts (5), weather, and the score. The player gets the notification of weather
                  condition of each arrival points. The weather information includes the temperature and feels like (temperature)
                  in degree celcius, and humidity in g/m^3. The program fetches the weather data from API of https://openweathermap.org/api,
                  maps data from the leaflet library,and data elements like continents, country, airport, municipality from flight_game database.</p>
